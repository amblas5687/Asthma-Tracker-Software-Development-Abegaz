# Asthma-Tracker-Software-Development-Abegaz
This repository holds the software developed in Software Development (CSCI 3300) at UNG. We have developed the beginnings of an asthma tracking software. We used Scrum to facilitate development. To see what our project looked like at given sprints, check out the sprint branches. For more information, see the README.

Welcome to our project! 

This project was started in Software Development (CSCI 3300) at UNG. This repository is a living project, meaning there are errors that exist, and it is far from polished. We only had two 2 week sprints to work on this project within the semester (fall 2016). You can view what the project looked like at given sprints by viewing the respective branches. 

Some things to be aware of:

This project used a local database on our personal computers. We have provided the correct SQL scripts, but the database connection code in the project may need to be modified. Also the executable which is in the sprint branches has an error with the IDE. The "Out of Breath" button on the main menu does not function. This is not an error with the code, but an error with the IDE that packaged the executable.
